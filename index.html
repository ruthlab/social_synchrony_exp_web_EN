        In this experiment, we would like to examine how the brain encodes social synchrony. However, before we move on to the brain, as a first step we would like to know do different people experience and understand social interactions in a similar way?<br><br>
        For this, we will examine your experience while you watch social interactions. In the experiment, you will watch short video clips from movies or TV series, while rating the level of synchrony between the figures, their affect or how much you identify with them.<br><br>
        Before each rating task, you will read detailed instructions regarding the feature and how to rate it. The rating is very simple, by moving a slider with your computer mouse. We will ask you for some basic details regarding your age, gender, birthdate and prior education and experience but we will not ask for any identifying or personal information.<br><br>
        You have the right to withdraw and terminate your participation at any stage of the experiment, by simply closing the browser window. We will be able to use only completed experiments. The expected duration to complete the experiment is about 15 minutes. The movie may include nudity/addictive substance use/violence. All the movies in the experiment are rated PG-13.<br><br>
        For additional details or questions regarding your participation, you may contact us via email expsyncrate@gmail.com . This experiment was approved by the ethical institutional review board of the Baruch Ivcher school of psychology at Reichman university, Herzliya, Israel.
